## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrik Alm and I have recently started to study programming, again. Last time was at VÃ¤xjÃ¶ university with ADA and this time at Lexicon in VÃ¤xjÃ¶ with the goal to be a fullstack developer with Java.

First time programming was with a VIC 20 and the language BASIC, some time ago... ðŸ˜„

And if you want a nice smile or something else check out Rafael's extended and fabulous list of emojies!<br>
