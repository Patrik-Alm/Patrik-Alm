## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Patrik Alm and I have recently started to study programming, again. Last time was at VÃ¤xjÃ¶ university with ADA and this time at Lexicon in VÃ¤xjÃ¶ with the goal to be a fullstack developer with Java.

First time programming was with a VIC 20 and the language BASIC, some time ago... ğŸ˜„
